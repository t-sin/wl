## Q&A

### Who is he?

He is a squirrel, Japanese squirrel.

### Why walnut?

One day, I went to Inokashira Park Zoo, to see squirrels. I spent pretty nice time there, really nice. Suddenly, When I saw a squirrel in front of me, another squrrel clambered my leg and my rucksack, then he do something on my rucksack. After he has gone, I checked my bag. The walnut is here, on my rucksack. He had mistake, he thought I was a branch of trees, he buried the walnut on my bag. I laughed and laughed. And I think, it's a nice walnut.
